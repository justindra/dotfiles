# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles-v2, instead of just using bash, I've decided to use ansible to make the configuration a bit nicer to support both MacOS and Ubuntu. Mostly based on [elnappo's](https://github.com/elnappo/dotfiles) dotfiles.

## TODO

* Add ansible config for Ubuntu and i3
* Find and add an i3 Alternative for MacOS
