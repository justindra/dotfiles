description: Git commit
---

commit the current changes. run git status before commiting to make sure that you know of all the files that have changed

make sure it includes a prefix like
feat: - A new feature
fix: - A bug fix
docs: - Added documentation
ci: - changes to ci
wip: - a work-in-progress of a change

if you are unsure of which prefix to use, if it could be either or, then ask

prefer to explain WHY something was done from an end user perspective instead of WHAT was done.

Commit messages should be brief since they are used to generate release notes.
