description: Git commit
---

commit the current changes. run git status before commiting to make sure that you know of all the files that have changed

make sure it includes a prefix like
feat:
docs:
ci:
ignore:
wip:

prefer to explain WHY something was done from an end user perspective instead of WHAT was done.

Commit messages should be brief since they are used to generate release notes.
